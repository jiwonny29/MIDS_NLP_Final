      "Index 1285: Actual: -1, Predicted: 0, Text: i purchased this rice milk powder with an open mind i had read other reviews that claimed it was too sweet or lumpy but decided to give it a go anyways here s what i found you must prepare this drink per the can instructions otherwise it is lumpy warm water and a blender are a must plus a container to store the prepared mixture in your refrigerator shake the prepared mixture before use because it quickly settles i found the taste to not be sweet but rather have a sweet smell it reminds me of the smell i get when i open a bag of honey nut rice cakes it is faintly reminiscent of cotton candy once you drink it the sweetness is very mild it is kind of like the lack of sweetness you experienced as a child when you bit into your cherry chapstick thinking it would taste like it smelled as for using it in coffee i haven t cared for it i used to drink half rice milk half coffee in the morning but it just doesn t have the consistency to stand up to coffee like my other rice milks do it separates quickly and gives the coffee a thick quality as for the price i did the math and it is only slightly less expensive than if i had purchased the trader joe s rice milk i normally get the packaging is correct that this rice milk travels well because the powder does not require refrigeration but then again i usually don t travel with a blender so that was a moot point for me i would have also liked it more if it was organic what i really like about this rice milk is that it uses less packaging when compared to aseptic boxes one can is like 16 small boxes it has a long shelf life it does not contain vitamin d2 i don t care to take synthetic vitamins i d rather use d3 but that s not usually vegan so you won t find it in rice milk it works as a milk substitute in recipes and i can use it in recipes that call for powdered milk sort of there isn t any protein in this rice milk and that s usually why most recipes call for using powdered rice milk as an ingredient so if that s what you wanted to use it for i would recommend going with powdered egg whites or powdered protein shake instead so you could easily use it for cooking or for breakfast but the idea of using it for a coffee creamer is out of the question it is almost unpalatable in coffee\n",

them to be successful i needed to locate about 10 or so holes make sure they did follow a tunnel and them bomb them all at one time it was somewhat effective and with no bodies to account for you never really knew these traps however work great ive never liked traps because theyd say something like find the main gopher tunnel and then place it in there etc and id think ya right point one out to me and id be glad to do just that ive killed 4 gophers so far using these traps two yesterday and one so far today 3 dead gophers and one a couple days ago what i have found effective so far still getting the hang of it is to either 1 find an open hole and use a stick and try to determine which direction it leads and then dig an opening in that direction about 1 2 feet away from its opening large enough to put two of these traps inside it back to back then set the traps put them inside cover up all the holes so no light passes into the tunnel and wait come back in an hour im sure most likely you got one no kidding see my uploaded pictures ive gotten 1 this way 2 if you find a hole that is closed plugged and the dirt plugging it is powdery is literally the consistency of powder then most likely a gopher is inside that tunnel in this scenario put one trap facing into the tunnel cover up all holes so no light can enter come back in about an hour or the next day for me 1 hour is suffice and almost certain you caught one no kidding ive gotten 3 this way 1 yesterday one today within 1 hour of setting this trap this way one thing to consider also three gophers so far were not dead when i pulled the traps out of the ground so i had to kill them myself they were hurt but no way dead all others were dead fyi and a nice point in addition if you see the spring portion up in the air when you approach your trap after youve set it in place this means 100 you caught a gopher springs up caught gopher final point in conclusion great traps they work by far the best out of anything ive tried so far by far great great traps remember find and active hole and set them in there using the methods above and you will kill gophers great traps wish i knew of them 15 years ago i hope this review helps i think these traps work great update killed 22 gophers so far as of 06 29 12 1 4 5 12 gopher leaving tunnel 2 4 8 12 one of these was killed using 2 traps back to back when gopher was re entering the hole the other gopher leaving tunnel 1 4 9 12 gopher leaving tunnel 1 4 10 12 gopher leaving tunnel 1 4 11 12 gopher leaving tunnel 2 4 12 12 gophers leaving separate tunnels 1 4 14 12

sank into the ground i dug the area and found a large fresh looking tunnel within 2 hours i checked back daily routine and caught a gopher took pictures and uploaded them set the trap and within 2 hours caught a gopher 1 4 25 12 gopher inside tunnel leaving tunnel one trap near opening inside tunnel 1 4 28 12 gopher leaving tunnel 1 4 03 12 gopher leaving tunnel 2nd kill same tunnel took about 7 8 days left trap in tunel surprised to have caught another in the same tunnel about 7 8 days later 1 5 05 12 gopher leaving tunnel saw a fresh new hole back filled with loose powdery dirt set trap about 6 hours later i check every couple few hours regularly caught gopher 15 1 5 6 12 same tunnel hole as 15 there was no other hole to set this trap in so i reset it in the same hole 2 5 9 12 gopher within tunnel and the second gopher this day was same tunnel as 15 and 16 3rd gopher in same tunnel 18 gophers so far 1 5 12 12 gopher inside tunnel used two traps 1 5 18 12 gopher 20 gopher inside tunnel was walking and heel sank dug into ground and found hole set one trap a few hours later was on the computer looked out window and saw the spring was up in the air only means one thing caught gopher 20 happy happy day see uploaded pic 1 6 3 12 gopher inside tunnel was leaving tunnel saw a new fresh powdery dirt plugged hole and set trap next day spring was up 1 6 29 12 old tunnel two traps had been in their for a couple weeks and i never took them out today one of the springs was up caught another one a small one but a dead one gopher 22 what ive learned after killing 22 gophers it seems as if each gopher has its own set of tunnels which are not shared by other gophers w few exceptions that is gophers went unchecked ignored and ruined our entire yard and front of house huge gulleys and very uneven ground is what remains you walk around out there and sometimes your entire foot sinks to your ankle after having caught a gopher in pretty much most of the tunneled areas none have come back so far so far but it does seem as if each gopher has its own tunnel system i have only caught gophers in different tunnels areas never in the same tunnel system area it just seems this way and like mentioned none have come back as of yet and i am going to be digging into all tunnels and back filling them with dirt of course then even more so a new opening entrance will mean an active tunnel this was how i caught my 9th gopher it dug a hole and then back filled its opening then later below it on a hill it dug another and i could see its head shooting in and out throwing out dirt i stood over witha shovel and made eye contact i then came back in about 10 min and set a trap in the first backfilled hole about 45 min later i checked and the spring had popped up caught that gopher 9 also and end of this post for now 8 of 9 gophers only one trap was used saw a fresh hole which was plugged from the inside which i also now know feel means it is an active hole tunnel set one trap for when it left 8 out of 9 kills went this way i caught only one gopher using two traps back to back gopher hole was open i dug infront of it about 1 2 feet set two traps and the gopher was caught on the way back in my conclusion if a hole is open set two and youll most likely catch it upon its re entrance if a hole looks fresh and plugged dig it open wide enough to set one trap then wait just go about your day and come back later almost certain you caught one if its an active hole active hole a hole that is open or plugged from the inside and the dirt that is plugging it is powdery not compacted like the desert ground all cracked looking it will look like fresh dirt was used to plug it very recently meaning that same day take all of this info and use it it worked for me 8 out of 9 were killed using one trap when the gopher was leaving its tunnel i literally destroyed its opening by digging it open with a shovel the felt for a hole found the tunnel using a stick made sure it went on for some ways then i set a trap butted up against the opening that i widened used some leaves to cover the holes in the set trap sprinkled loose dirt lightly and made sure no light entered from outside into the tunnel then waited went about my day every time spring was up caught gopher 3 of 9 werent dead had to kill myself but they were caught in the trap the sprung trap makes a very nice and ironically convenient handle to just grab and removed the whole thing from the ground with the butt of the gopher staring you in the face when you pull it up you never even have to touch the gopher i never cleaned mine off just reset the spring and reused the trap if it was an active hole i caught another simple simple simple good luck also see my uploaded pictures\n",

sound like an advertisement i should be i am this stuff is wonderful it boggles my mind that vernor s is not a national brand i figure the other manufacturers must be paying them to not compete because those other kids know if vernor s had the kind of distribution and availability that those other alleged ginger ales have those other alleged ginger ales would have to be removed from the market i don t have any real knowledge of this in fact i m making it up as i type but i have a pet conspiracy theory that i made up just now that the whole reason cadbury schweppe s bought the vernor s brand was so if worse came to worst they could always change the name of the place to cadbury vernor s spicy bubbly with a ginger and vanilla and who cares what else mix of flavors aged for four years in wooden barrels vernor s is the oldest soda in the us and it s still the best all over the world people drink 7 up for an upset stomach in michigan we drink vernor s people make root beer or 7 up or sprite floats with vanilla ice cream in michigan it s vernor s and hudsonville during the holiday season some people have egg nog we have warm vernor s some people have spiced cider we have warm vernor s some people drink rum and coke we drink rum and vernor s some soft drink connoisseurs suggest that the taste of vernor s is closer to some very small regional hot ginger beers i ve had a few

dead at the camera and says as only he can you warm your vernor s your way and i ll warm my vernor s my way that s some classic 80 s regional advertising right there i digress vernor s it cures cancer

mother opinion this product should not be 30 a small box but it is properly milled fine grind and probably on a small mill by a lot of people devoted to quality that part shows for quality it s not usda organic minus minus another for price and if it s kosher vegan add 1 2 not kosher certified on box i did find medium grind usda organic corn meal only in the local organic chain store new seasons is the only local grocery type store that has both 100 organic produce and packaged foods some traditional ones and for about 20 more than traditional groceries but a consistent stock responsive management friendly clerks and most importantly lots of stores they are all the same inside medium grind will not make a good tortilla it will crumble you need fine grind or a grinder the product being reviewed is the fine grind so why did i buy it it s the right grind for tortillas with the tortilla maker i bought the flavor is a bit different too not corny if you compare with the gmo cheapo tortillas from the usual grocery store but closer to the taste of a handmade organic tortilla you might find somewhere in a health food store like eerewon good luck with that erewon s mostly in los angeles or maybe whole foods did not check there if you re in berkeley ca try berkeley bowl if you re in washington or texas try central market trader joe does not have organic corn tortillas as far as i know i found one shop in my travels can t remember which shop so that s why i am doing it myself it s more fun this way and they can be frozen the idea is to make little dough balls great with kids grandkids kindergarteners and smash them so mix up the and distilled water and let it sit in fridge then make appropriate dough ball corresponding to whatever size tortilla you want it has to be cold but not frozen like playdough for grilled breads also you want it about as thick as an old lp vinyl record not too thin but not too thick make the thickness of one ceramic bath tile you ll know right away if it s too thin if it s not done in two minutes it s too thick if you don t have a cast iron press use a rolling pin or an empty wine bottle experiment with different flours but always heat and grease the machine first otherwise dough will stick testing with a drop or two of oil or water works i use organic flax or olive with a pastry brush you want a thin coat of oil then press if you re making tortillas get the pan greased and heated but also coat the tortilla press so the tortilla will press off i don t like plastic a sandwich baggie is another method for those who can t have any oil if you re vegan use egg substitute for the pizzelle post if that works if you re kosher no problem tortillas are paerve the griddle or the pan has to be hot and you have to watch it no turning of the back watch it or you will have a black tortilla or a well done pizzelle it s not a pancake it cooks longer and texture is different pizzelle should take one minute tops if everything is set up someday maybe i will make a youtube don t hold your breath you tube involves talking sound editing i don t know what else skills i am not great at in any event both keep in the freezer and can be thawed when ready to use by leaving on counter for a few hours or even in a pinch in a toaster and make good cheap nutritious snacks as long as healthy fats used and no sugar overload is in the pizzelle or dairy high fat cheesy stuff poured on top of either bread because they are both specialty breads and best with a bit of something but also good by themselves if fresh since first posting i notice this http www amazon com regular finely ground perfect recipes dp b0006n2pe0 ref pd_sbs_gro_5 and others with lower prices i don t know if it is same quality fresher etc but if you want fresh buy whole dry corn cut off cob yourself and mill it with a champion juicer mill attachment if you want purple pastry you can still find a better price and then compare quality food should be fresh regardless of who sells it to you it should not be 30 with s h it should be roughly what you pay at a specialty grocery store and if your local store has overpriced stock just print out the amazon ad and take it to the manager they will usually honor fair market value if they have something overpriced it s often because they did not first check amazon amazon does beat or meet most local grocery stores even on obscure gourmet items i suppose it s worth it if you want something fast live in wa get it without paying shipping and are going to use it for coloring baked goods naturally beet juice works well for that also it might be instructive to get someone to photograph small samples of all these flours so people don t have to buy a box and find out they don t have a recipe for it or it s stale or not what they expect and to have little descriptions of each sample like we do with hops wine cheese because all flours are not created equally the organic ones especially can be expensive but not this expensive sometimes the cost of s h is inflated because of s h policy that might be something not just this seller can look at and scrutinize most of my complaints very few actually considering how much i buy and how consistently i buy boil down to some shipping handling problem but s h will only communicate with seller who hired them it is generally only a problem with foodstuffs a broken machine can be photographed repackaged and often repaired locally food cannot there should be separate written policy for pricing packing and shipping foodstuff some vendors do a

calories per cup and 3 290 calories gram compared to the longevity line for adult dogs healthy weight has more calories per cup but a fewer calories per gram meaning that healthy weight has more grams per cup than longevity looking at the order of ingredients which is by pre production ingredient weight i am concerned that too much of healthy weight s protein may come from whole grains which do not contain all of the amino acids that a dog must get from his or her food dogs cannot synthesize all the amino acids they need from plants and grains the way humans can de boned chicken is the first ingredient but because it contains 75 water before processing it is not the heaviest final ingredient chicken meal is a high quality protein but it is listed as the fifth ingredient also at the bottom of this review i name a brand of food that ultimately helped me meet my dog s goals overview of weight control while i did not do all i could to make weight control work for my dog it ultimately did not help my dog reach his ideal weight blue weight control is nutrient rich very low in fat and uses high quality protein sources unfortunately blue weight control has 444 calories per cup which is pretty calorie dense i believe it was over 4 calories per gram which in human food is the caloric density of cheddar cheese my dog may have been able to eat a satisfying quantity of this food if he only needed to maintain a healthy weight but he needed to lose weight and the portions i had to feed him were too small fortunately blue buffalo makes an excellent food called a href http www amazon

of food per day details my dog weighed 50 lbs and needed to get to the maximum ideal weight for his breed 44 lbs as determined by my vet and the american kennel club according to several dog nutritionists the calories a dog should consume per day to lose weight is computed as follows 1 convert his goal weight in pounds to kilograms by dividing the pounds by 2 2 for my dog 44 lbs over 2 2 20 2 multiply her weight in kg by 30 for my dog 20 30 is 600 3 add 70 in my dog s case that meant 670 calories per day this number represents the dog s caloric needs while on a weight loss diet assuming the dog has no special needs such as pregnant or whelping being a puppy being a toy breed working or living outdoors in cold weather the formula only is valid if the dog weighs between 5 and 99 pounds check with your vet to make sure the daily calories you compute are in the right neighborhood the reason blue weight control was not the best blue buffalo food for my dog was because it is is relatively calorie dense 444 calories per cup to feed him 670 total calories per day i could only feed him 1 5 cups per day meaning that each of his two meals could only be 3 4 cups and that was without even a tiny buffer for a single green bean as a treat later i explain why i had to add in other foods i ended up only feeding him 2 3 of a cup for each meal and that really worried me about the adequacy of his nutrition this quantity of food is well below the feeding guidelines on the bag my dog was miserable and begged constantly he would even lick his empty bowl between meals i tried feeding him a 1 3 cup 10 calories of plain no added salt canned green beans as a snack just to help fill his stomach but he was not content and eventually turned his nose up at the green bean snacks i should have added warm water to his dog food and stirred in the green beans but i wasn t smart enough to do so at the time my dog kept acting hungry and begging for more dog food he would actually walk over to the bag of dog food put his paw on it and look at me while whining softly other members of my household would sneak table food to him because he begged so persistently and the diet was a abysmal failure my poor dog ended up actually gaining 4 more pounds from all the human cheating i was glad i found blue longevity adult food it has 354 calories per cup as opposed to 444 it has 3 384 calories gram i gave my dog 1 8 cups per day in 2 meals for 640 calories a saleswomen at petsmart explained that i could help increase my dog s feeling of fullness even more by adding warm water to to his food enough to just cover the kibble and letting it sit on the counter a minute so that the kibble would swell up i should then stir in 10 calories a little less than 1 4 cup of no added salt green beans to make it an even more filling meal i did all of these changes together so i can t separate the effects my dog stopped the whining and began to lose the weight i budgeted him only 10 calories per day for treats the problem was i had to find something to give as a treat at least 3 times per day see my dog lived in a no kill shelter for 18 month so i had to use treats to re housebreak him now he refuses to do 2 unless he is guaranteed a treat if he doesn t get one immediately after he goes he lies down on the ground and makes us carry him home even if we are two blocks from the house and it is dark and pooring down rain welcome to my world of loving an australian cattle dog i was surprised to learn that small sized milk bones have 20 calories each and contributed to

favorite folgers gourmet lively columbian is not the same and it doesn t come close to being as good we ve been drinking this specific coffee for years now though at times we are forced to drink something else because nobody can keep it in stock all the local stores run out constantly of folgers columbian it s hardly ever in stock and we buy as much as we can we have the same problem with amazon it s rarely in stock when it is in stock there s always only 1 2 or 3 left i get the email that it s in stock and that very day it says only left in stock the worst part that makes me really mad and i don t know if it s folgers ripping me off or amazon but i m really really mad that they are charging over 35 30 for subscribe and save which i did but it will probably get cancelled because they will run out of stock for a much smaller 27 9oz size tub than before 34 5oz 6 6 oz less per tub 19 8oz less for 4 more or for the same price with s s then compare current prices for other flavors 6 oz less per tub for columbian over 18 oz less coffee for the same brand different flavor on the same day from the same store amazon and it is not currently in stock at my grocery stores locally so i m stuck paying this outrageous price or changing coffee which i have tried before and might have to try again by the looks of things 3 tubs of foldgers columbian 27 8oz each for 35 or 30 subscribe save or 3 tubs folgers classic roast 33 9oz each for 31 64 regular price not subscribe and save is folgers charging more for columbian and therefore amazon is charging more for less coffee than i used to get for the same price sometimes less or since amazon has it flying off the shelves they can sell the smaller tubs for the same price as they used to charge for the bigger tubs or only stock the smaller tubs and then sell them for the same price as the other flavors because it is such a popular flavor folgers still makes the large tubs of columbian because i just bought them two weeks ago when my local store had a whopping two tubs in stock for the price i am now paying for the small tub just last year i repeatedly bought from amazon 3 tubs of folgers columbian 34 5oz each for 31 24 regular price not subscribe and save now i get 27 8 oz for 35 30 for 3 tubs that s 6 7 oz less for the same price but the other flavors are still at the cheaper price i just want to know who decided to rip off all the people who are paying for this coffee to fly off the shelves folgers themselves or amazon and is there some legitimate reason or is it just because it s popular so if you can charge us more money for less product you might as well i am a huge fan of amazon and have never had any problems here for many years they have excellent personalized customer service and make most things easier and most of the time cheaper than anywhere else the only problems i ve read about from other people seem to be from outside independent sellers so i m trying to be open minded that maybe it s folgers not amazon but i am really angry that the price is in my opinion skyrocketing for what seems to be just because they can with no consideration for loyal folgers and loyal amazon customers by one company or both i know i know i should just buy some other coffee absolutely it s our choice which coffee we buy at least as long as we have a free country i am completely against price fixing and believe in a democratic society where the free market is a free market and businesses exist for the sole purpose of employing people and making a profit otherwise they would all be non profit agencies and or charities and not employ very many people etc but none of that stops me from wanting to know why if amazon s price didn t go up i don t think mine should by such a huge margin or raise all the coffee a little instead of jacking up one flavor to make up for the increased cost of all coffee production and if it s not costing folger s this huge amount more to make the coffee then why does it cost me that much more or does it suddenly cost that much more to make only folger s brand columbian coffee dare i ask is columbian coffee suddenly skyrocketing because we didn t sign the free trade agreement with columbia i really want to know what the heck is going on so i can start adjusting to the ridiculous price increase or start all over again trying to find a new decent cup of coffee last time it was out of stock everywhere i tried 8 different kinds of coffee and none of them held up my rant is officially over i need to go make another pot of coffee hopefully when i come back it won t cost more than diamonds just writing the review has inspired me to get to the bottom of this bottom line great coffee recent price jump knocks of two stars\n",
